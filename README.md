# Immigration Patterns in Canadian Cities and Languages Spoken in those cities

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and visualize Canadian immigration patterns to different major cities through the lens of the languages spoken. 
By combining demographic and linguistic datasets, we will create a narrative that illustrates how different immigrant communities cluster in major Canadian cities, showcasing the cultural and linguistic profile of each major city center.
