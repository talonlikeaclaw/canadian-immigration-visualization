### Work Times

    - Habib is not due to work.

### Response Delay

- We are expected to respond to any queries within 24 hours (within reason).
- If anyone is unable to finish a task in time, or they will be busy, or potentially unable to work on the project, they should communicate with their teammates as soon as possible. Communication is key.
    - We will communicate through our Discord server in these cases.

## Decision Making

- Any new or non-required features have to be approved by the other teammates during the meetings before the issue is created.
- We will create issues on GitLab for any tasks that need to be done and let the other teammates know by sending the issue link.
- Any discussions on an issue should take place in the comments of the issue.

## Merge Request Expectations

- No giant merge requests (one issue per MR).
- An MR should be associated with an issue. 
    - Create the MR from the issue on GitLab.
- An MR should be approved by at least one team member.
    - The reviewer should thoroughly check through the MR.
- The MR should pass the `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline.
    - If the pipeline fails, the author is responsible for fixing it.

## Team Policies

### Team Conduct

- We all show equal commitment to our objective. We all take part in deciding how work should be allocated.
- We are committed to helping each other learn. We acknowledge good contributions from team members.
- We handle disagreements and conflicts constructively within the team.
- We are able to give constructive criticism to one another and to accept it ourselves.
- We all turn up to meetings and stay to the end. We are good at making sure that everyone knows what’s going on.
- We are willing to share ideas with each other openly.
- We are able to ask each other for help when necessary.
- When one of us is under pressure, they inform the rest of the team.
- When one of us is under pressure, others offer to help them. We trust each other.
- We do not share private discussions or internal project material outside the team.
- Everyone is encouraged to share learning resources and help each other improve.

### Communication & Collaboration

- We should communicate as much as possible to keep each other informed about project progression.
- When we add a new issue on GitLab for a task, we inform each other through Discord to avoid duplicate work.
- We use Discord for day-to-day communication and GitLab issues/comments for project-related discussions.

### Conflict Resolution

- If a disagreement arises:
  1. Discuss the issue respectfully in the associated GitLab issue, or during the next meeting.
  2. If unresolved, the Coordinator will mediate and help make the final call.
  3. Major conflicts affecting workflow should be reported to the course instructor as a last resort.

### Code & Development Standards

- Commit messages should be short, imperative, and descriptive.
- Commits should be frequent and meaningful.
- Keep commits focused on a single concern. If you fix unrelated issues, use a separate commit.
- New features should be tested before creating a merge request.
- Always run the project locally before opening an MR to confirm that no errors occur.

### Code Review Policy

- Be respectful and constructive when reviewing each other's work.
- Reviews should check:
  - Code readability and naming consistency.
  - Adherence to project conventions.
  - Potential optimizations or security issues.
- The MR author should resolve all comments before merging.

### Deadlines & Deliverables

- Each issue should have a clear due date on GitLab.
- We aim to complete tasks **at least one day before** the official deadline to allow review time.
